#### Project Objective:
This project aims to classify skin images into specific disease categories to assist dermatologists in integrating AI for detecting skin conditions.

#### Disease Categories:
- Melanoma
- Melanocytic nevus
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Actinic keratosis
- Benign keratosis
- Dermatofibroma
- Vascular lesion

#### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a subset of the HAM10000 dataset, available at: [Harvard Dataverse.](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) 
- Images in the 'train' file will be used for training and validation.
- Images in the 'test' file will be used exclusively for testing.
- The file HAM10000_metadata.csv is used to identify the class of each image.

#### Constructed Models:
- CNN-based Model: 
A deep learning model designed for multi-class classification with multiple hidden layers.
